| ------- | ----------- | --------- |
| | <h4 align=center> **Section: Strengthening Visibility**</h4>||
| <p align=center> **1** | Strengthening Visibility refers to organizations’ abilities to monitor, detect, and understand activity within their networks. High visibility means having detailed insight into network traffic, user activity, and data flow, allowing network defenders to quickly identify threats, anomalous behavior, and vulnerabilities. Visibility is critical for network engineers and defenders, particularly when identifying and responding to incidents. | Enhanced visibility is an inherent advantage of the public cloud model, particularly in [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com). This transparency is not just a bolted-on feature, but a fundamental necessity driven by the application programming interface (API)-centric, pay-as-you-go business model. To accurately bill customers and maintain non-repudiation, AWS has built comprehensive tracking and logging capabilities into its core architecture. As a result, AWS provides robust tools that you can use to capture, centralize, and monitor logs across every layer of your network workload. <br /><br />This level of visibility extends far beyond what's typically achievable in traditional infrastructure, offering you unprecedented insight into your information technology (IT) assets and user activities.<br /><br />The following are a few examples:<br /><br />Resource initiation, modification, and termination happen through API calls which are automatically recorded ([AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail)). <br />Asset Management and Configuration Management can be accomplished using [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config). <br />Logs of user actions on compute instances can be generated and stored securely with [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).<br />Data flows can be captured using [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc) Flow Logs, [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) access logs, and DNS logs to name a few.  | 
| | <p align=center>**Monitoring**| |
| | <p align=center> **Network Engineers**||
| <p align=center> **2** | Closely scrutinize and investigate any configuration modifications or alterations to network devices such as switches, routers, and firewalls outside of the change management process. Implement comprehensive alerting mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to the network, including unusual route updates, enabled weak protocols, and configuration changes (i.e., changes to users and Access Control Lists [ACLs]). Store configurations centrally and push to devices. Do not allow devices to be the trusted source of truth for their configuration. Monitor configuration and, if feasible, test and override on a frequent basis.  | In AWS, you can implement infrastructure and configuration as code, which allows for central storage of configuration in repositories, tracking changes through version control, and implementing changes through approved change management processes. You can use code repositories and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the implementation of these configurations, helping you increase deployment speed, maintain consistency, simplify management, and implement a rigorous and auditable change control process.<br /><br />The following are a few AWS services that can help you:<br /><br />AWS code management and CI/CD tools include, [AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy),  [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline), and [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecrww), and code repositories can include GitLab or GitHub.<br /><br />[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config) can track configuration changes to AWS resources. You can enforce approved configuration and automatically initiate remedial actions if a resource’s configuration doesn’t match the approved config. You can also write custom AWS Config rules to take automatic actions whenever sensitive resources are modified, or take advantage of more than 400 AWS provided managed AWS Config rules that send alerts or create automatic remediations when critical resources change state.<br /><br />With [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations) you can help prevent non-compliant actions using [Declarative Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative.html), [Resource Control Policies (RCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.html), or [Service Control Policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html). <br />Declarative policies allow you to centrally declare and enforce your desired configuration for a given AWS service at scale across an organization. After a declarative policy is attached, the configuration is maintained when the service adds new features or APIs. For example, you can block public internet access to Amazon VPC resources across your organization.<br />RCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for resources in your organization, while SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for the IAM users and IAM roles in your organization.<br /><br />AWS services also use automated reasoning, a field of computer science that attempts to provide assurance about what a system or program will do or will never do. You can use this feature through [Amazon Verified Permissions](https://aws.amazon.com/verified-permissions) to help build more secure applications. Using this, you can decouple authorization from code, centralize policy management, support fine-grained permissions management, integrate with existing identity providers, support role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) controls, and enable auditing and compliance management. |
|<p align=center> **3** | Implement a strong network flow monitoring solution. This solution should allow for network flow data exporters and the associated collectors to be strategically centered around key ingress and egress locations that provide visibility into inter-customer  | AWS offers powerful logging and monitoring services. These logs can be stored securely in a tamper-proof manner and made available to authorized teams (such as your security operations center team) for anomaly detection, incident detection, and incident response.<br /><br />API calls are logged using [CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/how-cloudtrail-works.html). <br /><br />You can use [CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) to monitor your applications.<br /><br />Amazon [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html), Amazon [S3 access logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html), and [Route53 DNS logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/logging-monitoring.html) generate information on network flows.<br /><br />Beyond AWS native services, AWS also supports open source approaches to OpenTelemetry. See [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws.amazon.com/otel/)  | | If feasible, limit exposure of management traffic to the Internet. Only allow management via a limited and enforced network path, ideally only directly from dedicated administrative | You can achieve network micro-segmentation, a critical aspect of modern security architecture, through VPCs and subnets. You can, for example, segregate internet-facing components of your application from those that don’t require such access by placing them in separate VPCs and enabling internet access only on the VPC that requires it. You can control traffic flows within and between segments using a variety of network services—routing tables, internet gateways, transit gateways, and firewall services to name a few. This segmentation minimizes your risk from exploitations that originate from the internet and limits the potential for lateral movement in the event of a breach.<br /><br />[Amazon VPC Block Public Access (VPC BPA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html) is a straightforward, declarative control that authoritatively blocks incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) VPC traffic through AWS provided internet paths. VPC BPA enables you to maintain compliance with your organization’s security and compliance requirements by centrally blocking AWS provided internet access to resources in your VPCs. When set to bidirectional block, all ingress and egress VPC traffic is denied.<br /><br />Using AWS VPC through NAT gateways and internet gateways can then allow for controlled access to the internet (for example, for software upgrades and other approved access) without exposing internal network addresses. You can also use [AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/) to inspect and filter inbound and outbound traffic, including intelligent threat detection.<br /><br />You can architect your network connections to separate management traffic from network signaling traffic using subnets—for example, a single [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2) instance can have multiple elastic network interfaces (ENIs) attached to different subnets or even different VPCs: one that permits only management traffic and another that permits only signaling |
| <p align=center> **4** | Monitor user and service account logins for anomalies that could indicate potential malicious activity. Validate all accounts and disable inactive accounts to reduce the attack surface. Monitor logins occurring internally and externally from the management environment. | With AWS, you can design your workloads to limit all routine human access to production workloads. For access during emergencies, you can implement break-glass procedures that tie access to an issue ticket and limits access to a specific duration (such as the duration of troubleshooting). See [Temporary elevated access management](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/temporary-elevated-access-management-with-iam-identity-center/) for an example architecture. <br /><br /> The [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam) offers a powerful set of features that you can use to control access to your workloads on AWS.<br />You can use [AWS IAM Identity Center]() to implement single sign-on and integrate with an existing corporate Microsoft Active Directory or an external identity provider. This makes sure that Joiners-Movers-Leavers (JML) processes can be linked to the control of access privileges to AWS resources. For example, the access of employees who are no longer part of the organization or have changed job roles will be automatically updated.<br />IAM also supports ABAC, which can limit access based on user attributes such as user location. |
|<p align=center> **5** | Implement secure, centralized logging with the ability to analyze and correlate large amounts of data from different sources. Encrypt any logging traffic destined for a remote destination via IPsec, TLS, or any other available encrypted transport options. Additionally, store copies of logs off-site to ensure they cannot be modified or deleted. Enable logging and auditing on devices and ensure logs can be offloaded from the device.If possible, implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool to analyze and correlate logs and alerts from the routers for rapid identification of security incidents. Ensure logging takes place at all levels of the environment, network operating system, application, and software levels, as it pertains to network devices.Establish a baseline of normal network behavior and define rules on security appliances to alert on abnormal behavior.| You can implement centralized logging in AWS by using [Amazon Security Lake](https://aws.amazon.com/security-lake) together with [OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/opensearch/) implemented in separate accounts, with access restricted to just your security team. You can design your production environment to securely stream these logs to centralized logging accounts and storage buckets. These stored logs are cryptographically protected for confidentiality and integrity.<br /><br />References:<br />[Amazon Security Lake](https://aws.amazon.com/security-lake/)<br />[Introducing Amazon OpenSearch Service and Amazon Security Lake integration to simplify security analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-opensearch-service-zero-etl-integration-for-amazon-security-lake/)<br />[Centralized Logging with OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/centralized-logging-with-opensearch/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| <p align=center> **6** |Ensure the inventory of devices and firmware in the environment are up to date to enable effective visibility and monitoring.  | With a single API call to [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/how-does-config-work.html) you can determine the AWS resources that are in use including their configuration information. AWS Config also tracks configuration changes and can enforce approved configurations.                                                                                                                                     |
| | <p align=center>**Network Defenders**||
| <p align=center> **7** |Implement a monitoring and network management capability that, at a minimum, enforces configuration management, automates routine administrative functions, and alerts on changes detected within the environment, such as connections and user and account activity. <br />Establish understanding of the architecture of infrastructure and production enclaves, as well as where the two environments meet or are segregated. Map and understand boundary and ingress/egress points of the network management enclave.<br /> Understand which assets should be forward facing and remove those that should not be forward facing. <br />Closely monitor all devices that accept external connections from outside the corporate network and investigate any configurations that do not comply with known good configurations, such as open ports, services, or unexpected Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) or IPsec tunnel usage. Threat actors have been observed taking advantage of external-facing vulnerable services and features; therefore, proper visibility of network and security operations is vital.<br />If appropriate, implement a packet capture capability as part of the broader visibility effort for the enterprise. Determine capture location(s) and retention policies based on organizational demands. | Using AWS constructs such as [Landing Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-aws-environment/understanding-landing-zones.html), multiple accounts, VPCs, and subnets, you can segment your workloads to limit the impact of a security incident (limiting the ability of bad actors to move laterally). You can use these constructs to architect your workload in a way that limits the ingress and egress points to your network.<br /> AWS also offers firewall services ([AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf), [AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/), and third-party appliances through the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace)) and load balancers ([Gateway Load Balancers](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/gateway-load-balancer/)) that you can use to monitor ingress and egress traffic including traffic capture for anomaly detection and blocking malicious traffic.<br /> You can use configuration management services (AWS Config, [AWS Firewall Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/firewall-manager)) to programmatically manage configuration of your network devices, detect changes, and create automations for remediation if needed. For an example involving a telecom Landing Zone, see [Establishing a foundation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/your-telecom-cloud-journey-on-aws-part-1-establishing-a-foundation/).|
| | <h4 align=center>**Section: Hardening Systems and Devices**</h4>||
| <p align=center> **8** |Hardening device and network architecture is a defense-in-depth strategy. Reducing vulnerabilities, improving secure configuration habits, and following best practices limit potential entry points for PRC-affiliated and other cyber threats.|In AWS, the shared responsibility model for security can help lower your burden. AWS is responsible for security of the cloud, which means that AWS assumes responsibility for securing everything about and inside the cloud services it provides, all the way down to the physical protection of data centers. AWS has a state-of-the-art vulnerability management program that includes regular tests of AWS services and identification and prompt resolution of issues. AWS also assists you with hardening your workloads (your portion of the shared responsibility). For example, AWS offers [Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) (both Amazon and third-party through Amazon Marketplace) that are security hardened operating systems that you can use.<br /><br />[Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector) automatically discovers workloads, such as EC2 instances, containers, and [AWS Lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda), and scans them for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.|
| | <p align=center>**Protocols and Management Processes**| |
| | <p align=center>**Network Engineers**||
| <p align=center> **9** |Use an out-of-band management network that is physically separate from the operational data flow network. Ensure that management of network infrastructure devices can only come from the out-of-band management network. In addition, confirm that the out-of-band management network does not allow lateral management connections between devices to prevent lateral movement in the case that one device becomes compromised. Ensure device management is physically isolated from the customer and production networks. When properly implemented, out-of-band management can mitigate many threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)| In AWS, virtual networks are defined using software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This means that you can segment your network using software techniques and be sure of traffic separation. You can architect your network to separate different traffic types (such as production and management) using networking concepts such as elastic network interfaces (ENIs) and subnets. You can control which traffic types are allowed on each interface using network access control lists (NACLs) and built-in firewalls (security groups). You can use [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager) for API-based management actions on your node.|
| <p align=center> **10** |Implement a strict, default-deny ACL strategy to control inbound and egressing traffic. Ensure all denied traffic is logged. For maximum depth, implement on separate devices from those implementing other security controls. | AWS services are designed to be secure by default and secure by design. When a user initiates an AWS resource (such as an S3 bucket, a VPC, or a subnet) the default configuration is default-deny. For example, in the case of a subnet, all traffic is automatically dis-allowed by the NACL unless you configure an explicit allow. You can also log network traffic (allowed, deny, or both) using VPC Flow Logs. <br />[Amazon VPC Block Public Access (VPC BPA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html) is a straightforward, declarative control that authoritatively blocks incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) VPC traffic through AWS provided internet|
| <p align=center> **11** |Employ strong network segmentation via the use of router ACLs, stateful packet inspection, firewall capabilities, and demilitarized zone (DMZ) constructs. Separation via virtual local area networks (VLANs) and, if possible, private VLANs (PVLAN) will provide additional granular logical separation. This should be done as part of a broader defense-in-depth approach that protects and isolates different device groups.<br /><br />Place externally facing services, such as Domain Name System (DNS), web servers, and mail servers, in a DMZ to provide segmentation from the internal LAN and backend resources.<br /><br />Additionally, as a general strategy, put devices with similar purposes in the same VLAN. For example, place all user workstations from a certain team in one VLAN, while putting another team with different functions in a separate VLAN.<br /><br />Do not manage devices from the internet. Only allow device management from trusted devices on trusted networks. Use dedicated administrative workstations (DAWs) connected to dedicated management zones.   | In AWS, virtual networks are defined using SDN. Using concepts such as VPCs and subnets allows you to segment your network and ensure traffic separation. Subnets (a concept similar to VLANs) can be private (no exposure to traffic from the internet) or public. Traffic flows between subnets can be controlled using routing tables and inspected using firewalls. You can isolate your VPC from internet traffic and impose fine-grained access controls in and out of your subnets using security groups.<br /><br /> AWS offers firewalling capabilities that customers can use to control traffic and perform packet inspections, such as [AWS Network Firewall ](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/features/)and [AWS Route 53 DNS Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-dns-firewall-overview.html).|
| <p align=center> **12** |Harden and secure virtual private network (VPN) gateways by limiting external exposure, if possible, and limiting the port exposure to what is minimally required (for example udp/500, udp/4500 and protocol type 50 (ESP)). Ensure all VPNs are configured to only use strong cryptography for key exchange, authentication, and encryption. <br /><br />Disable unused VPN features and cryptographic algorithms to prevent exploitable weaknesses.| You can use AWS services to securely access your cloud workloads from on-premises systems. These services can help protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data as it moves between the cloud and your location. <br /><br />[AWS virtual private gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/how_it_works.html) are a managed service that you can use to connect multiple VPCs to on-premises resources based on site-to-site VPN.<br /><br />Using [AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect), you can to connect to AWS using a private connection instead of the internet.<br /><br />You can use [AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) to obtain [temporary security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) in IAM for workloads such as servers, containers, and applications that run outside of AWS.|
| <p align=center> **13** |Ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.| Encryption, a cornerstone of data protection, is comprehensively addressed at AWS.<br /><br />Data on the AWS backbone network is automatically encrypted when it leaves a data center. Furthermore, traffic between supported Amazon EC2 Nitro instance types is automatically encrypted. This is in addition to encryption you might have already implemented at the application level.<br /><br />AWS services can be accessed through TLS v1.3 encrypted endpoints. AWS services also support post-quantum TLS. For example, [AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms) and [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager) support a hybrid post-quantum key exchange option for the TLS network encryption protocol.<br /><br />You can also use AWS cryptographic services such as AWS KMS, [AWS CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/), and [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://aws.amazon.com/acm) to help secure your data in transit and at rest. |
| <p align=center> **14** |As a management policy, control access to device Virtual Teletype (VTY) lines with an ACL to restrict inbound lateral movement connections.<br /><br />Additionally, disable outbound connections to mitigate against lateral movement. Monitor for changes as adversaries can modify this configuration on compromised devices to allow outbound | The control plane of AWS services is through APIs that use strong authentication and authorization using [SigV4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html). They are also protected by TLS v1.3 (and a minimum of TLS 1.2). API calls are logged (using CloudTrail). Interactions between AWS services themselves are controlled in the same manner and use the same APIs. Implicit trust is not assumed between services. <br /><br />[AWS Systems Manager Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html) provides a secure way to access your AWS compute infrastructure without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys. |
| <p align=center> **15** |Ensure all authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) logging is securely sent to a centralized logging server with modern confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA)| AWS API calls use strong authentication and authorization (SIGv4, OAuth2).|
| <p align=center> **16** |If using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), ensure only SNMP v3 with encryption and authentication is used, along with ACL protections against unnecessary public exposure. Ensure configuration with the most secure cryptographic options supported by the hardware.| Under the shared responsibility model, AWS manages the security of underlying infrastructure. This includes maintaining up-to-date systems and services, disabling insecure protocols and unused ports, and providing Security Bulletins for timely vulnerability notifications. |
| <p align=center> **17** |Disable all unnecessary discovery protocols, such as Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). If they are required, only enable on the necessary interfaces.| You use SDN and NFV concepts to create virtual networks in AWS. These operate at Layer 3 of the  [Open Systems Interconnections (OSI) model](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/osi-model/). Using security groups, you can help avoid open ports and unexpected traffic, limiting the capability of bad actors to move laterally. |
| <p align=center> **18** |Ensure Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.3 is used on any TLS-capable protocols to secure data in transit over a network.<br />Ensure TLS is configured to only use strong cryptographic cipher suites.<br /><br />Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based certificates instead of self-signed certificates. <br /><br />Implement a robust process to renew certificates before they expire. | AWS API endpoints support TLS v1.3 and a minimum of TLSv1.2 (v1.0 and 1.1 are disabled). <br /><br />AWS APIs primarily use the Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM) cipher suite, which is considered a highly secure standard, with most services employing 256-bit encryption keys and incorporating key derivation functions like HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)  for added security; this is typically combined with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for signing operations. |
| <p align=center> **19** |Disable Internet Protocol (IP) source routing. | N/A for AWS workloads|
| <p align=center> **20** |Disable Secure Shell (SSH) version 1. Ensure only SSH version 2.0 is used with the following cryptographic considerations. For more information on acceptable algorithms, see NSA’s Network Infrastructure Security Guide.<br /><br />Configure with minimally a 3072-bit RSA key.<br /><br />Configure with minimally a 4096 Diffie-Hellman key size | AWS offers an AWS Systems Manager service with a [Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html) feature that provides secure node management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.|
| <p align=center> **21** |When possible, apply secure authentication to protocols and services which allow it, such as Network Time Protocol (NTP), Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS+), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP). Similarly, disable any unauthenticated management protocols or functions, such as Cisco Smart Install.  | In its use of the BGP, AWS uses Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) and Route Origin Authorization (ROA) to help protect the Amazon IP address space and routes from misconfigurations and hijacking. For more information, see [How AWS is helping to secure internet routing(https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/how-aws-is-helping-to-secure-internet-routing/)]. |
| <p align=center> **22** |Use secure cryptographic building blocks when building VPNs such as: <br /><br />Key Exchange:<br /><br />Diffie-Hellman Group 15 with 3072-bit Modular Exponential (MODP)<br />Diffie-Hellman Group 16 with 4096-bit Modular Exponential (MODP)<br />Diffie-Hellman Group 20 with 384-bit Elliptic Curve Group (ECP)<br /><br />Encryption: AES-256<br /><br />Hashing: SHA-384 or SHA-512 | AWS virtual private gateways primarily use cipher suites that support TLS 1.2 or later and include Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE), helping to ensure strong encryption with modern standards. AWS recommends using TLS 1.3. |
| <p align=center> **23** |Ensure that no default passwords are used.<br /><br />Change all default passwords on first use. <br /><br />Ensure no passwords are reset back to the default. | AWS management accounts are protected by strong passwords and require multi-factor authentication (MFA). You can use IAM to define strong password policies and enforce MFA for your users who access AWS resources. <br /><br />Furthermore, with AWS, you can remove the use of root passwords altogether, making AWS accounts secure by default. Privileged actions that originally required root access can now be performed with [(https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/centrally-managing-root-access-for-customers-using-aws-organizations)], a secure alternative that is short-term and task-scoped to specific accounts. |
| <p align=center> **24** |Confirm the integrity of the software image in use by using a trusted hashing calculation utility, if available.<br /><br />If a utility is unavailable, calculate a hash of the software image on a trusted administration workstation and compare against the vendor’s published hashes on an authenticated site as a trusted source of truth. This may require engaging the device’s maintenance contract to access source of truth hash values. For additional security, copy the image to a forensic workstation and calculate the hash value to compare against the vendor’s published hashes. | AWS offers services such as software image repositories (such as Amazon ECR) and CI/CD pipelines (CodePipeline and CodeDeploy) that you can use to securely store software images, validate them using cryptographic methods using [AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) for image signing, verify security (scan for malware), and deploy them into production. <br /><br />You can also use workflows to create and keep up-to-date, golden images. AWS supports cryptographic attestation mechanisms that can provide assurance of the integrity and authenticity of your software environment. |
| | <p align=center>**Network defenders**||
| <p align=center> **25** |Disable any unnecessary, unused, exploitable, or plaintext services and protocols, such as Telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Trivial FTP (TFTP), SSH v1, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) servers, and SNMP v1/v2c. Ensure any required internet-exposed services are adequately protected by ACLs and are fully patched. | You can use AWS networking features such as security groups and NACLs to disallow specific protocols by types, for example HTTP, FTP, SSH, and so on. You can use AWS firewall services (AWS WAF and Network Firewall) to block specific traffic types.     |
| <p align=center> **26** |Conduct port-scanning and scanning of known internet-facing infrastructure to ensure no additional services are accessible across the network or from the internet. Remove unnecessary internet-facing infrastructure, monitor necessary internet-facing infrastructure, and continuously validate the architecture. <br /><br />Routers with an active shell environment—even if they have not been tampered with— have significantly more listeners running at the operating system (OS) level compared to the software level. | Using AWS networking constructs such as VPCs and subnets, you can architect your workload on AWS in a manner that isolates workloads that don’t require internet access from those that do. For workloads that are internet-facing, you can use AWS firewall services (AWS WAF and Network Firewall). Security groups are built-in firewalls that control the incoming and outgoing traffic for Amazon EC2 instances. <br /><br />Furthermore, AWS provides services—AWS Config and Amazon Inspector—that can help you assess network configuration and identify reachable ports on EC2 instances without requiring that you install a port scanner on each machine. <br /><br />Configurations of virtual routers on networks in AWS are modified through secure, well-documented, authenticated, and authorized APIs that are logged.  |
| | <p align=center>**Network defenders and network engineers should ensure close collaboration and open communication to accomplish the following:** |  |
| <p align=center> **27** |Ensure all networking configurations are stored, tracked, and regularly audited for compliance with security policies and best practices.<br /><br />Whenever networking configurations are transmitted for storage, tracking, and troubleshooting, confirm that they are sent using encrypted protocols. Additionally, be sure they are not attached to plaintext emails or sent via FTP or TFTP.  | Using AWS services, you can deploy infrastructure as code. Furthermore, you can decouple configuration from code. This helps you increase deployment speed, maintain consistency, simplify management, and implement a rigorous and auditable change control process. <br /><br />AWS Config can help track the configuration of AWS resources and enforce preferred configurations. Changes to route tables are done through secure, well-documented, authenticated, and authorized APIs that are logged. |
| <p align=center> **28** |Monitor for vendor end-of-life (EOL) announcements for hardware devices, operating system versions, and software, and upgrade as soon as possible.| With AWS, you consume cloud services through well-defined APIs. AWS is responsible for making sure that the system that underpins these services stays up to date, eliminating your need to worry about EOL infrastructure components. AWS supports these APIs and services through contractually defined support terms (See [AWS Service Terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/)). <br /><br />You are only responsible for your application software, which is run atop AWS infrastructure and environment services. This significantly lowers your operational burden. |
| <p align=center> **29** |Implement a change management system that anticipates both routine and emergency patching. Continuously monitor for vendor vulnerability and patch announcements and ensure patches are applied in a timely manner. Ensure use of vendor recommended version of the operating system for the features and capabilities required. <br /><br />Test and validate patches as part of the change and patch management processes.  | AWS offers services that help you manage vulnerabilities. AWS Inspector automatically discovers workloads, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and Lambda functions, and scans them for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.<br /><br />AWS offers CI/CD services that you can use to automate the deployment process including automated testing of routine and emergency patches. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can automate the patching of EC2 instances based on defined criteria you set.<br /><br />Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are the recommended way of maintaining known good state for your instances, so you can make use of immutable infrastructure rather than patching production running instances.<br /><br />Furthermore, architecting your workload in accordance with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support-well-architected) helps you to patch your software and address vulnerabilities in a timely fashion.<br /><br />Amazon notifies you of vulnerabilities through [Security Bulletins](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/). |
| <p align=center> **30** |As part of a broader password policy, store passwords with secure hashing algorithms. Passwords should meet complexity requirements and should be stored using one-way hashing algorithms or, if available, unique keys. Follow National Institute of Standards and Technologies guidelines when creating password policies.  | AWS has multiple services and features that can assist you. With IAM, you can set a custom password policy on your AWS accounts to specify complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for IAM users' passwords. <br /><br />[Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) can help you securely manage, retrieve, and rotate database credentials, application credentials, OAuth tokens, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycles.|
| <p align=center> **31** |Require phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts that access company systems, networks, and applications, including sensitive administrative access to routers. MFA should use a combination of credentials and a phishing-resistant secondary verification method, such as hardware based PKI or FIDO authentication, to ensure secure access and prevent unauthorized entry.  | With IAM, you can configure MFA for the AWS account root user of all of your AWS accounts, including standalone accounts, management accounts, and member accounts and for IAM users. IAM also supports identity federation and enforces MFA checks. Using service control policies, you can enforce MFA when calling AWS APIs.  |
| <p align=center> **32** |As part of a broader identity and access management policy, use local accounts only for emergencies and change the passwords after each use. Verify that each use was authorized and expected. For everyday management of network infrastructure, use a centralized AAA server that supports multi-factor authentication requirements; however, ensure the AAA server is not linked to the primary corporate identity store.   | You can implement [secure break glass access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/break-glass-access.html) in AWS to manage emergency access to your AWS resources.   |
| <p align=center> **33** |Limit session token durations and require users to reauthenticate when the session expires. Conduct audits to determine the standard session duration for each role to implement session expirations. | IAM enforces session duration that you can configure to enforce periodic authentication. IAM also supports temporary credentials, which is the primary mechanism by which to communicate with AWS services and APIs, using the [Security Token Service (STS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/). |
| <p align=center> **34** |Implement a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) strategy that assigns users to a specific role with defined and inherited permissions to better control and manage what users can do.  | IAM supports RBAC roles. By using IAM, you can create and manage roles and groups, assign permissions, and control who can access AWS resources.  |
| <p align=center> **35** |Remove any unnecessary accounts and periodically review accounts to verify that they continue to be needed. Apply the principle of least privilege to make sure accounts only have the minimum permissions necessary to complete their tasks. Additionally, continuously monitor accounts in use.  | You can use [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations) to manage accounts within your organization. Accounts can be deactivated as needed to adhere to business requirements. Access to AWS resources can be federated through corporate identity directories or third-party identity providers. |
| | <p align=center>**Secure by Design** | |
| <p align=center> **36** |The authoring agencies urge software manufacturers to incorporate secure by design principles into their software development lifecycle to strengthen the security posture of their customers. Software manufacturers should prioritize secure by design configurations to eliminate the need for customer implementation of hardening guidelines. Additionally, customers should demand that the software they purchase is secure by design. For more information on secure by design, see [CISA's Secure by Design webpage](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign). Customers should refer to CISA’s Secure by Demand guidance for additional product security considerations. | AWS services are secure by design and secure by default. AWS is a signatory to [CISA's Secure by Design Pledge](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge/statements-of-support). <br /><br />See the [Building Security from the Ground up with Secure by Design whitepaper](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/new-whitepaper-available-building-security-from-the-ground-up-with-secure-by-design/) that AWS authored with the SANS Institute. The whitepaper addresses secure by design strategy and explores the effects of secure by design implementations.
